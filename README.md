# Groovebot
An example repo for what building a bot for Grooveboat looks like. This was
originally built for helping me debug certain issues, but eventually this will
turn into a nice roombot that will do some basic moderation, idle DJ queueing,
etc.

## Setup
Clone the repo, cd in, run:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

```bash
$ yarn start [number of bots to spin up]
```

then you'll be presented with a simple CLI. Check out the code for
documentation, as this will likely change very soon.
